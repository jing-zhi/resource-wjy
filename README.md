说明：此仓库是我收集或自行修改的有用资源和工具，为开源项目，大家有好的皆可补充完善

目前有的：typora 超好用主题

typora-css：即 typora 主题（具体可使用感受，帮你爱上写笔记，解决烦恼），我横向对比了有道云，typora，还有思源，等最少7、8种笔记软件，最喜欢的一直使用的就是 typora 笔记
（当然它也有它的不足，例如没有图床，需要自己搭建，也没有云笔记方式，想要备份，要木自己推到 github 这种，要木找个第三方同步，例如坚果还是啥来着忘了名字，还有阿里云盘，现在可以同步文件夹了，牛，百度网盘等）
喜欢的原因：自定义主题，尽管这在开始需要探索一定时间，上网搜很多，才能找到适合自己的，然后还要对其中一些进行修改来适配自己。所以这一款就是我改过的，一直用的，别的都不用（我从大概至少20种里筛选的），原因就是我最喜欢这个 Autumnus Dark 主题的，黑色的主题，我会觉得能沉进去心，很专注，同时很有安全感，而且不是亮黑色，是相对柔和的黑色，所以才能做到安全感，沉浸感

Explanation:：gathered useful resources and tools that I have collected and self modified

currently available: Typora super user-friendly theme

typora-css：refers to the typora theme (specific user experience, help you fall in love with writing notes, solve problems). I compared at least 7 to 8 note taking software such as Youdao Cloud, typora, and Siyuan horizontally, and my favorite one that I have been using is typora notes

(Of course, it also has its shortcomings, such as the lack of a picture bed, the need to build it by oneself, and the lack of cloud note taking methods. If you want to backup, you need to push it to GitHub on your own, and find a third-party to synchronize, such as Nut or something that you forgot its name on. There are also Alibaba Cloud drives, which can now synchronize folders, such as Niu and Baidu Netdisk.)

Reason for liking it: Custom themes, although they require some exploration time and a lot of online searching to find what suits you, and then some of them need to be modified to fit you. So this one is the one I have modified and used all the time, and I don't use anything else (I filtered out at least 20). The reason is that I love this Autumn Dark theme the most. The black theme makes me feel engrossed, focused, and secure. It's not bright black, but a relatively soft black, which is why I can achieve a sense of security and immersion
